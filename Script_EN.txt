...
But isn't the one listening to me right now - also you?
(William) Huh? Sure.
(Lila) And the one seeing me is you. And the one feeling all the different things is you.
Let's call this <i>you</i> the perceiver.
(William) Uh-huh
(Lila) We like to imagine the perceiver as a pupil of an eye. The perceiver may cast his gaze upon anything -
colors or sounds, touch or feelings. But how do you imagine it looking at itself directly?
(William) A mirror?
(Lila) Oh I wouldn't trust the mirror, my dear William. 
The ghosts on the other side may only look like us.
(William) So, alright, in that sense it really can't. 
The pupil can never see itself. So what?
(Lila)

It means that whatever the pupil can perceive is not it.

(William) Huh? What do you mean?
(Lila) For you - where do other people exist? I mean, their minds, memories and so on?
(William) In their heads?
(Lila) Wrong. You have no ability to see what's inside someone's head.
To you people are a fictitious creation - a number of expectations generated from their actions,
a phantom existing exclusively in your head. 
(William) ...
(Lila) And the funny thing is - your own personality is too.
(William) What? I'm real, Lila. Even if other people may be imagined by me, my own character is...
(Lila) What's the definition of imaginary?
(William)  ...
(William, SlightlyScared)Something that exists just in my mind?
(Lila) And where does you personality reside?
(William)...
I...
(Lila) It's alright, my sweet William.
You, your memories, your mind - these are only temporary shards of colored glass. 
The Visioner, the Perceiver, the Prince may only look through them and imagine for a moment that he <i>is</i> these shards.
He never truly becomes them and it's surprising, how quickly he may look away from one to another.

I've been helping out at the little farm near Father Lawrences church.
I'm not sure what he needs all those animals for, though.
No one from the brethren seems to be eating them, yet some animals disappear after time.
Is he breeding and selling them or something? It's confusing.
<i> July 14 </i>
They say I'm pretty good with Lila's enforcement. Father Lawrence told me not to write her name down, 
but I'd rather trust her than him. I think the others may be jealous, since she started talking to me so quickly...

I don't think they know what they are talking about. Tulpas are a very personal thing,
It can't be that their Lila is the same as mine.
It's just a part of <i>me</i>, it can't be connected to them.
We are not connected.
<i> September 15 </i>
She scared me today, by the way. 
Lila did. 
She started talking about the Prince and stuff
<s>Not the musician</s>, she has her own idea of how things like personalities and egos work)
I don't believe her, but for a moment I felt really lost and unsure of what my <i>me</i> really consists of.

[HardProblem]
(null)The philosopher Thomas Nagel posited in his 1974 paper "What is it like to be a bat?"
that it is incorrect to claim that something felt, like the color red,
is the same as the impulses in the brain "creating" it.
He believes that subjective experiences are inexplainable, at least scientifically,
because "every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view,
and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view."

[HardProblem2]
(null)<i>the handwriting here is really horrible</i>
Apart from Chalmers', other formulations of the hard problem of consciousness include:
"How is it that some organisms are subjects of experience?"
"Why does awareness of sensory information exist at all?"
"Why do <i>qualia</i> exist?"
"Why is there a subjective component to experience?"
"Why aren't we <i>philosophical zombies?</i>"

<i> Some pages were untouched by fire <i>
...For us, the most comfortable way to contact him was by using a special Yantra
For beginners, an eighth-Tolae of Teth mushrooms is often required, 
however, experienced members of the group may manage without them

INSTRUCTION:
1. Position the Yantra so its center is at eye level and a comfortable distance away. 
Sit with your spine straight. Breathe in and out slowly until your breath flows naturally.
2. Look at the center or "dot" which represents the unity that underlies all the diversity of the physical world
3. Now allow your attention to expand, engulfing the outer square of the Yantra. Do not move your eyes from the dot, however.
4. Gradually span your attention across the sacred figure. As you reach the outer contour, you will already be

Um, can you elaborate? Did you change your name?
(null) No. The name Lila was assigned to me by the worms of Lawrence. Although, I've been known by many names since the dawn of humanity.
(DH) Could you elaborate?
(null) A child is born. And with him come the shadowy figures. Each child has a roughly similar set of them. 
Some of the shadows are hazier, some take form after some time. 
The children never see us, but we are always there, pulling the strings. 
And when a child invites me in, I can't resist it.
(DH) So, are you saying, this is not William I'm speaking to right now?
(null) It is not. But do not worry, you know who I am.
After all, you were born with me as well. 
I am the one snatching children from their sleeping mothers. 
I am the nocturnal queen,

(null) You don't seem to understand. I want to talk to detective Yu now.
(DH) Look, bud, there's no detective by that name here. 
Now, let's go back to what we were discussing. 
Do you know this girl?
(null) Of course. She is the reason I am here, talking to you.
(DH) And why is that exactly?
(null) Because she looks exactly like me. And because my little William slaughtered her.
(DH) William being?..
(null) This boy's assigned name. 
William Clarke. 
He was the one to invite me in. 
(DH) I see. So are you saying that I am now talking to some being inhabiting the body of William Clarke?
...
You know Will, it's a very common thing guilty people do. 
They come up with those stories to clear their conscience. 
But it was <i>you</i>, who did it, wasn't it? 
(null) William did this, yes.
(DH) But you <i>are</i> William.
(null) ...
I want to talk to detective Yu
(DH) I already told you, there isn't a detective by that name here.
So, back-tracking a bit... Alright, if Will did this, how did he do it?
(null) I don't know everything. 
He was able to tire me out, to keep me hungry long enough, so I didn't look through his eyes anymore. 
But I remember him meeting this.. 
(null, Irritated)copycat girl. 
(null, Neutral)The spark of remembrance was nutritious enough for me to catch a glance of her.
It all happened in a room, full of people. 
There was music. 
(DH) Are you, by any chance, talking about Matt Hurley's party?
(null) Then, I could catch glimpses more often. 
They talked about silly things and then, he must have started remembering. 
I saw clearly. She looked just like me. 
Not nearly as beautiful, but I see why William could confuse us two. 
He thought I came back for him. 
He thought she was me. 
So that's why he slaughtered her. 
(DH) How did he do it?
(null) He strangled her. And.. And then.. Hahahah
It's hilarious. He cried like an infant, the stupid guy. 
He couldn't take it in, the thing that was unraveling before his eyes. 
Delicious.
So I had to step in. All in all, it was a happy coincidence. 
I had to clean up after him though. 
Cut the body to pieces. 
(DH) ... We have found a book about tulpas in William's drawer. 
Would you claim that you are his tulpa?
(null) The worms liked to call me that. They thought they had control. 
But they are no Gods. 
You humans can't create anything new. 
So all you do is create artificial empty spaces in your head, in hopes that someone like me comes and fills it up. 
And so I came. They believed it was a product of their thought, 
but I was here all along.

That's when he saw me for the first time.

(null, Neutral) Well that's easy. 
The brethren may have been stupid, 
but Lawrence has always suspected the satanic and deeply occult nature of our world's order. 
The streams of social will are in fact supported by this one thing... 
You see, there have always been works of art, music, poetry and prose that would live on outside the will of their creators. 
These works were able to capture something so deeply suppressed, 
something shared so universally between people that they were able to live on without the author's control. 
With the introduction of the world wide web, such works have been digitalized. 
Lawrence was simply seeking a way to birth such digital artifacts on a regular basis. 
I was supposed to be the generator of them. The animals...

(null) No-no, even before that.
Something happened between them before, no doubt.

(null, SubtleSmile) Oh, of course, Sir.
We were standing in the corridor with Tanya, looking at a painting

He saw us two.

(null) She was great, honestly. She cared about me a lot.
A bit too much at times.
(DH) How's that?
(null) Well, she'd meet me from school until I was about twelve
She always knew what was up with me. Was very strict about my grades,

But I've been helping out Father Lawrence for a while before I was actually initiated.
(DH) Alright. Then, what was the mission of the group?
Did you try to convert as many people as possible?
(null) Not really, Sir. Actually, 
it seems that only Fathers closest circle was allowed in.
As for the end goal, I was never told what it was, or if there was one.
It seems, I was too low of a tier.

(null) Yeah. Her name was Annie.
(DH) Did your mom know?
(null) Yes, yes she did.
She didn't like that, obviously. She started talking to me a lot about her, trying to convince me that 
I shouldn't be interested in girls yet, or something.
(DH) Hm, that couldn't have been true. I mean, how old were you?
(null) Fifteen
(DH) So, what happened then?
(null) At some point she stopped with her lectures.
I thought she was finally cool with my choices.

(DH) What did your mother do?
(null) She asked if she could talk to us. 
We said yes, so she sat us across the table

(null, Confused) I think death means different things to us, Yu
(null, Neutral) I won't die if you shoot a gun at me.
But a full understanding of my story.
A loss of interest that closure brings, that's...
Well, nevermind, forget it. 
What about you?
(Yu) I'm not sure. I've died many times, but all I was met with was a different dream.
(null, Neutral) Along your path, have you ever stumbled upon a man with six arms and snake eyes?
(Yu) I.. I have, just once. 
(null) When you leave me and this dream, try to recall what he said.
You are in a very special position right now.
You have the opportunity to either jump into the wheel again, or be free of dreams forever. 
(null, SubtleSmile)Don't waste it. This time, try to make death be the end of Yu.
(Yu) We have to get back to the dream.

You might not know it, but I've been watching you intently, Lila
From the point William woke up in his apartment
Right until the end.
(null) So? Did it help you?
(Yu) Not.. yet. 
I'm still not quite sure

If I'm being frank, I have almost no damn idea about what happened before
Or after this day
(null) I appreciate your bluntness, detective.
...
Does it feel right that William is most likely going to be prosecuted?
(Yu) I'm.. Not sure.
You see, at that point I didn't know William that well.
...
To be quite honest with you, I feel a bit cheated
I'm not sure if the way it ended was the victory of good
Or a terrible mistake

(null) You do have the power to divert the way some events go
(Yu) You won't lull me into the false sense of safety, Lila
Even if I did that, now I know for sure -
In the garden of forking paths there'll always be one that leads to Mr. Graves being falsely accused
...
This card is an objective evidence of that
(null, SubtleSmile) Not bad detective. 
Many others will try to deceive themselves
Thinking that only one of the many paths is real
Yet they all exist simultaneously, intersecting
(Yu) In a weird way
They seem to dictate each other's logic too

I'm not sure if I can grasp the picture in it's entirety yet, though...

Memories, habits...
Although sometimes you get something good.
(Yu) Are you referring to yourself?
(null) Well, obviously
You humans still need something to see me as
So you construct a projection of me

It is a mother, who devours her children, stealing them from the real world.

(Yu) Why do you yourself need a reel then?

Lawrence's worms tried to make an instrument out of it
They made a reel artificially

Still, I like to imagine him some other place
As clear-minded and childlike as the fool.
Not remembering and not assessing the junk around him.
