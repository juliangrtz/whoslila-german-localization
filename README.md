Unofficial German localization for the brilliant game *Who's Lila?*

*Who's Lila?* is a horror adventure game developed by Garage Heathen and published by Garage Heathen and IndieArk. It was released on Steam and itch.io for Microsoft Windows on February 23, 2022. *Who's Lila?* follows a young man named William Clarke who has trouble showing the proper emotions on his face and has to consciously move his muscles in order to make expressions. This forms the main gameplay mechanic of the game, where the player must morph William's expressions with a mouse to make the proper (or improper) expressions during conversations. This affects how other characters react to his dialogue and how conversations play out.

Will is the last person who saw a missing girl, Tanya Kennedy, alive and must navigate conversations with various characters, such as his classmates and the police, in order to avoid suspicion. At the same time, the player's goal is to uncover the many mysteries contained within the game, such as what happened to Tanya and of course, who Lila is.

The game includes several endings, which depend on places the player chooses to go and what expressions they make William do. In addition, it features ARG elements, as it requires using external sources and websites in order to gain the full picture and access to every ending.

Who's Lila? is a project developed solely by Garage Heathen, who designed and programmed the game, as well as composing the music for it. He often posted behind-the-scenes screenshots and photos about the game's development on his Twitter account.
