## Introduction

*Who's Lila?* is a horror adventure game developed and published by Garage Heathen. It was released on Steam and itch.io for Microsoft Windows on February 23, 2022. *Who's Lila?* follows a young man named William Clarke who has trouble showing the proper emotions on his face and has to consciously move his muscles in order to make expressions. This forms the main gameplay mechanic of the game, where the player must morph William's expressions with a mouse to make the proper (or improper) expressions during conversations. This affects how other characters react to his dialogue and how conversations play out. This is an unofficial German localization for *Who's Lila?*. It only works for the newest version of the game, which is build ID 9156161 (right-click the game in Steam, select Properties > Updates). Since this localization – unfortunately – is unofficial it requires asset modification.

## Installation

Copy the modded `sharedassets0.assets` file and the original `sharedassets0.assets.bak` file into the game's `WhosLila_Data` directory. If you want to localize the DAEMON's text too then do the same but for `DAEMON\sharedassets0.assets`. This time, however, you have to replace the file located at `DAEMON\DAEMON_Data` in the installation path of *Who's Lila?*.
The installation path can be found by right-clicking the game in Steam and then selecting Manage > Browse local files.

## Known issues

Unfortunately, the fonts in the game render certain German characters not that well, especially so-called umlauts (öüäÖÜÄß...).

## To do

- Find a way to insert the sound files into `sharedassets0.assets`
- Fix typos
- Fix umlauts
- Check localization quality
